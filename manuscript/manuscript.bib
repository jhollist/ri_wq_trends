The data needed to calculate measures of lake morphometry, particularly lake depth, are usually collected on a lake-by-lake basis and are difficult to obtain across broad regions. To span the gap between studies of individual lakes where detailed data exist and regional studies where access to useful data on lake depth is unavailable, we developed a method to predict maximum lake depth from the slope of the topography surrounding a lake. We use the National Elevation Dataset and the National Hydrography Dataset – Plus to estimate the percent slope of surrounding lakes and use this information to predict maximum lake depth. We also use field measured maximum lake depths from the {US} {EPA's} National Lakes Assessment to empirically adjust and cross-validate our predictions. We were able to predict maximum depth for ∼28,000 lakes in the Northeastern United States with an average cross-validated {RMSE} of 5.95 m and 5.09 m and average correlation of 0.82 and 0.69 for Hydrological Unit Code Regions 01 and 02, respectively. The depth predictions and the scripts are openly available as supplements to this manuscript.},

	abstract = {Abstract Either phosphorus or nitrogen can be responsible for nutrient limitation of algae in lakes. Nitrogen limitation can be defeated by heterocystous cyanobacteria through nitrogen fixation, but no comparable mechanism exists for P. Therefore, P is considered the predominant factor limiting phytoplankton biomass in lakes. Even so, increasing numbers of studies show that many lakes are limited by N deficiency because heterocystous cyanobacteria do not become sufficiently abundant to offset N deficiency. Where N limitation prevails, P control over phytoplankton populations can be achieved only if P concentrations are first reduced to a saturation threshold that is determined by the amount of available N. The extent of this reduction, which will typically occur without any suppression of phytoplankton biomass, can be estimated from nutrient chemistry, nutrient enrichment experiments, and information on the stoi-chiometry of phytoplankton, as illustrated with data for a Colorado reservoir in which a reduction of N of about 50\% would be necessary to induce P limitation. Analysis based on stoichiometry could allow managers of water quality in lakes to anticipate the implications of N limitation for P-based management of water quality.},

Overall nutrient concentrations have decreased by 16 ({SRP)}, 26 ({NH3-Tot)} and 36\% ({TP)} in the harbour, chl a concentrations have decreased by 16\% and {NO3/2} concentrations have increased by 27\%. Hypoxia in the hypolimnion of Hamilton Harbour remains a common occurrence despite improvements in surface water quality conditions. Seasonal patterns in water quality in Hamilton Harbour are mainly driven by biological activity and show typical patterns observed in dimictic nutrient rich lakes. There is systematic spatial variability in water quality in the harbour which is related to the proximity of point and non-point sources; however, there is coherence among all stations sampled and similar temporal trends were observed for all stations. The biological response in the harbour suggests that phosphorus limited algal growth is becoming more prevalent in Hamilton Harbour and the rate of improvements in water quality should accelerate in the near future following further reductions in phosphorus loadings.},

	abstract = {Phytoplankton is one of the four key biological quality elements to be used in the ecological classification of lakes in Europe according to the Water Framework Directive ({WFD).} Chlorophyll a (Chla) has so far been used as the main – and sometimes only – metric to define class boundaries. Chla is often a key metric for lake managers and is used to determine whether and how much action should be taken to reduce the external nutrient loading. In this paper we present the analyses of empirical relationships between nutrient (total phosphorus, {TP}, total nitrogen, {TN)} concentrations versus Chla and the proportion of cyanobacteria of total phytoplankton biomass based on data from 440 Danish lakes (1800 lake years). These data represent one eco-region sampled using standardised methodology, thereby minimising the heterogeneity often seen in large datasets. Sampling frequency is important for the precision by which Chla can be determined and the precision is always low with less than 15 summer measurements. As expected Chla was related significantly to {TP}, but the variability was high, with R2 reaching only 0.47, 0.59 and 0.61 in shallow, stratified and siliceous lakes, respectively, based on summer averages. The correlation was strongest in late summer (R2 up to 0.80) and weak in winter. Chla is also related to {TN}, but the correlation coefficients were low throughout the year, and in a multiple regression with {TP} included, {TN} only added little to the total variability. Similarly, the proportion of cyanobacteria increased significantly with {TP}, but the correlation was weak. Seasonal and yearly data from five lakes with relatively stable {TP} show considerable variations in Chla and cyanobacteria abundance during a 20-year monitoring period. It is concluded that despite clear nutrient phytoplankton relationships it will be difficult to define the proposed {WFD} ecological classes – particularly regarding cyanobacteria. To ensure a high degree of certainty for meeting a specific water quality threshold, lake managers must reduce the external phosphorus loading more strongly than expected from existing simple empirical external loading-inlake {TP–Chla} relationships.},

This study investigates two methods of how monthly Chl-a medians can be predicted (i) new monthly regression models from median summer total phosphorus concentrations and latitude, (ii) and with monthly constants added to regression models from the literature. Data from 308 lakes were used and the trophic status of the lakes ranged from oligotrophic to hypertrophic, they were located from northern Sweden (Europe) to southern Florida (North America). These models may be useful for understanding the general Chl-a seasonality in lakes and for managing lakes in which Chl-a measurements are not made over the whole year.},

	abstract = {The response of mean ice-free chlorophyll a in 15 stratified, P-limited oligotrophic and mesotrophic lakes in central Ontario to changes in mean epilimnetic total phosphorus ({TPepi)} within a lake was highly variable between years during the period 1976–87. The linear regression coefficient of determination, R2, using all annual means was only 0.36, and within-lake regressions revealed mostly random associations between chlorophyll a and {TPepi.} Neverthless, by using the long-term average of annual means for each lake, a bivariate linear regression model was developed relating the long-term, average response of chlorophyll a to the long-term, average {TPepi} concentration in these lakes (R2 = 0.78). Annual variation could not be explained by changes in epilimnetic total nitrogen to total phosphorus ratio ({TN/TP).} The R2 increased slightly from 0.78 to 0.82 with {TN/TP} as a second independent variable using long-term averages but remained at 0.78 with {1/TPepi} as a second variable.

Néanmoins, au moyen de la moyenne à long terme des moyennes annuelles pour chaque lac, un modèle de régression linéaire à deux variables reliant la réponse moyenne à long terme de la chlorophylle a à la concentration moyenne à long terme du {PTépi} (R2 = 0,78) dans ces lacs a été élaboré.

The model developed to examine the source and delivery of nitrogen to the estuaries of nine large rivers along the {NE} {US} Seaboard indicated that agricultural sources contribute the largest percentage (37\%) of the total nitrogen load delivered to the estuaries. Point sources account for 28\% while atmospheric deposition accounts for 20\%. A second {SPARROW} model was used to examine the sources and delivery of phosphorus to lakes and reservoirs throughout the {NE} {US.} The greatest attenuation of phosphorus occurred in lakes that were large relative to the size of their watershed. Model results show that, within the {NE} {US}, aquatic decay of nutrients is quite limited on an annual basis and that we especially cannot rely on natural attenuation to remove nutrients within the larger rivers nor within lakes with large watersheds relative to the size of the lake.},

	abstract = {Cyanobacterial toxins constitute one of the most high risk categories of waterborne toxic biological substances. For this reason there is a clear need to know which freshwater environments are most susceptible to the development of large populations of cyanobacteria. Phytoplankton data from 134 {UK} lakes were used to develop a series of Generalised Additive Models and Generalised Additive Mixed Models to describe which kinds of lakes may be susceptible to cyanobacterial blooms using widely available explanatory variables. Models were developed for log cyanobacterial biovolume. Water colour and alkalinity are significant explanatory variables and retention time and {TP} borderline significant (R2-adj = 21.9\%). Surprisingly, the models developed reveal that nutrient concentrations are not the primary explanatory variable; water colour and alkalinity were more important. However, given suitable environments (low colour, neutral-alkaline waters), cyanobacteria do increase with both increasing retention time and increasing {TP} concentrations, supporting the observations that cyanobacteria are one of the most visible symptoms of eutrophication, particularly in warm, dry summers. The models can contribute to the assessment of risks to public health, at a regional- to national level, helping target lake monitoring and management more cost-effectively at those lakes at the highest risk of breaching World Health Organisation guideline levels for cyanobacteria in recreational waters. The models also inform restoration options available for reducing cyanobacterial blooms, indicating that, in the highest risk lakes (alkaline, low colour lakes), risks can generally be lessened through management aimed at reducing nutrient loads and increasing flushing during summer.},
